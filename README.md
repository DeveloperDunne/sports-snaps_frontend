### MoSCoW

![MoSCoW screenshot](./README_Images/admin_images/MoSCoW.webp)

This project used the "MoSCoW" method to classify its features and requirements according to their importance towards a minimum viable product (MVP). "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have," with each classification aiding in the prioritisation of features. This method makes sure that essential components are tackled in priority order.

## The Scope

### Main Site Goals

* To provide users with a good experience when using the website.
* To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive to use and easy to navigate.

* The ability to contact admin if required.
* The ability to update and delete comments if desired.
* The ability to interact with community by commenting, following and liking posts.

## Features

### Navigation Bar:
![Navigation Bar - Not Logged in](./README_Images/site_images/)

A responsive navigation bar is situated at the top of the page. When on a mobile the bar condenses into a burger icon which will enable a dropdown menu, however on a desktop all pages are displayed along the bar. What is shown in the navigation bar depends on whether the user is logged in or not.

### Not logged in:

When not logged in you will be able to see the following pages: Home, Sign In, Sign Up and Contact.

When logged in the Register and Sign-in page disappears and instead you will see the following.

### Landing Page

Upon arrival to the website, the landing page will be loaded. Here you will be able to see posts that authorized users have already posted drawing you into what is to come.

### Contact Page
![Contact](./README_Images/site_images/)

The contact page consists of a form that the user can fill out and submit if they have any questions.

### Sign Up Page

This page is a form where the user can sign up to reap the benefits of being a logged in user.

### Sign In Page
![Sign in](./README_Images/site_images/)

This page is where the user can sign in so that they can have access to the benefits of being a authorized user.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to implement but did not get time to would be a notification feature where authorized users would be notified when someone tat they follow posts a new photo.

I would also liked to added more styling to the overall look of the site however I just ran out of time.

## Credits

### Code
The CI walkthroughs (DRF Rest Framework API & Moments) were leaned on and relied upon heavily in this project due to time restraints, there are still some remnants of legacy code within. As I was really pushed for time to complete the project I used the CI code and initial styling as a base before implementing my own custom features and styles. 

I created a Contact model where users can contact the admin if equired by filling out a form and also added a category feature.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to the Slack community and especially tutors which I relied on a lot for all their help throughout this project. Also thank you to my friends and family for help with testing the project.
