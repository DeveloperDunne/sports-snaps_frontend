# Planning

## Agile Methodology

* All functionality and development of this project were managed using GitHub Projects. This can be found here at [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/DeveloperDunne/projects/6/views/1).

## MoSCoW

This project used the "MoSCoW" method to classify features and requirements according to their importance towards a minimum viable product (MVP). "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have," with each classification aiding in the prioritization of features. This method makes sure that essential components are tackled in priority order.
